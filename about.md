Hi, I'm Mustafa Erg√ºl, and welcome to my personal blog page. I am an IT Engineer, currently working at Travis CI as a Support Engineer. In the past, I had some experience with some well-known companies and nice projects as well as great people. As I do love my job I also a big fun of traveling and exploring new spaces and cultures. I am also very curious about the history science.

The goal of this website is to introduce myself and also share some of my knowledge on professional and social life as well.

I hope you will find some useful stuff here! :)
